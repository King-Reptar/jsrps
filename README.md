Javascript Rock/Paper/Scissors

This project is being completed as part of the Javascript Fundementals section of The Odin Project.

Project started Jan 23, 2023. It has taken me longer than expected to get this to the point where the computer's choice is returning a random move. Might take awhile to figure out the rest. I was overcomplicating things at first. But, so far this is simply calling an item from an array randomly.
